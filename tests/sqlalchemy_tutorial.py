# Metadata #
# Having a single MetaData object for an entire application is the most common case, represented as a
# module-level variable in a single place in an application, often in a “models” or “dbschema” type of package.
# There can be multiple MetaData collections as well, however it’s typically most helpful if a series of Table
# objects that are related to each other belong to a single MetaData collection.

# Defining Table Metadata with the ORM #

# Instead of declaring Table objects directly, we will now declare them indirectly through directives applied
# to our mapped classes. In the most common approach, each mapped class descends from a common base class
# known as the declarative base. We get a new declarative base from the registry using the
# registry.generate_base() method:

# mapper_registry = registry()
#
# Base = mapper_registry.generate_base()

# The steps of creating the registry and “declarative base” classes can be combined into one step using the
# historically familiar declarative_base() function:

Base = declarative_base()
